title: Another Blog Attempt
---

I've tried to keep a blog a few times in the past and the result was always the
same, I would forget about it after a while.

I learned from these attempts what I believe it's essential to go beyond the
_huge_ amount of 3 posts per blog:

- Write about anything;
- Enable commentaries;
- Enable feed support;
- Invest on the environment;

What I'm trying to do right now, it to invest on the enviroment, so I'm creating
my own blog layout and I'll use/create plugins I think are necessary. This way,
I believe I will start thinking about it not only as a way to share but also as
a way to do what I most enjoy -- developing.

So, if you think I'm missing something, don't be shy and ping me!
