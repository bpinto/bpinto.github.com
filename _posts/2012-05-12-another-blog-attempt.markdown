title: Another Blog Attempt
tags: [blog]
---

I tried blogging a few times in the past but the result was always
the same: The blog was **abandoned** after a while. From these attempts, I think
I've learned what I believe is essential to go beyond the *huge* amount of 3
posts per blog:

- Write about anything
- Engage with your blog's readers (if any)
- **Invest on the environment**

## Investing on the environment

There are several ways one could invest on his blog environment, e.g., using
a good blog platform, using a good blog layout, etc.

I'm using [Jekyll][] - a static site generator - as my blog platform, it
improves my **limited** blogging capacity. Mixing it with the joy of building my
first blog layout... I can only preview a wonderful blog ahead!

[Jekyll][] has many [Plugins][] one could use in order to improve their blog and it
also seems easy to develop new ones if necessary. With this in mind,
I believe I will start thinking about the blog not only as a way to learn & share
but also as a way to do what I most enjoy -- developing.

Lastly, but not least, I'm using [github][] as a remote repository and to host
the blog.
