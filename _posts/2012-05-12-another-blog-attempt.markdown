title: Another Blog Attempt
tags: [blog]
---

I tried to have a blog a few times in the past but the result was always
the same: I would **ignore** it after a while. From these past attempts, I think
I've learned what I believe it's essential to go beyond the *huge* amount of 3
posts per blog:

- Write about anything;
- Enable commentaries;
- Enable feed support;
- Invest on the environment;

What I'm trying to do right now, is to invest on the enviroment. I'm creating
my own blog layout and I'll use / create [Jekyll][]
plugins whenever necessary. This way, I believe I will start thinking about it not
only as a way to share but also as a way to do what I most enjoy -- developing.

What's your opinion about this? Am I missing something? Ping me!
